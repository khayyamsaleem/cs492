To ensure that only one philosopher at a time attempts to eat,
we simply wrapped the access of forks and the release of forks in a
mutually exclusive semaphore. This assures that only one philosopher
may attempt to pick up forks and begin eating at any time. The same
goes for dropping forks; as the forks are a shared resource, we must
protect them when both picking them up and dropping them.
