For task 2, we assured that only 4 philosophers were allowed to ATTEMPT
to eat (pick up forks) at one moment by including a pthread condition.
For any given philosopher, their access to the forks is permissed ONLY if
the number of philosophers currently eating is less than 4. If it is NOT
less than 4, the philosopher is forced to WAIT on the pickup_fork operation
(pthread_cond_wait),and is only allowed to continue once the condition
"releases" and signals (pthread_cond_broadcast) to the other threads
that it is okay to add another philosopher to the number that are eating.
For safety, an assert statement was added to ensure the solution worked.:w
